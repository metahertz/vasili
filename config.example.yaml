# Vasili Configuration File
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize as needed.
# All settings are optional - defaults will be used for any missing values.

# WiFi interface preferences
interfaces:
  # Preferred interfaces, ordered by priority (first = highest priority)
  # Cards are leased in this order when available
  preferred:
    # - wlan0
    # - wlan1

  # Interfaces to exclude from use entirely
  excluded:
    # - wlan2

  # Dedicated interface for scanning (optional)
  # If set, this interface will be used exclusively for network scanning
  # scan_interface: wlan0

# Module settings
modules:
  # List of enabled module names. If not specified, all modules are enabled.
  # Module names correspond to the Python file names in the modules/ directory
  # (without the .py extension)
  enabled:
    # - openNetwork
    # - wpa2Network
    # - speedtest

# Network scanner settings
scanner:
  # Interval between scans in seconds
  scan_interval: 5

# Web interface settings
web:
  # Host to bind to (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces)
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  # Port to listen on
  port: 5000
  # Set to false to run in headless mode (no web interface)
  enabled: true

# Logging settings
logging:
  # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  level: "INFO"

# Captive Portal settings
captive_portal:
  # MongoDB connection string for storing portal patterns
  # Set to empty string to disable pattern storage (portal detection still works)
  mongodb_uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017/"

  # Detection timeout in seconds
  detection_timeout: 10

  # Authentication timeout in seconds
  auth_timeout: 15

# Auto-selection mode settings
auto_selection:
  # Enable automatic connection selection and switching
  # When enabled, Vasili will automatically select the best available connection
  # and switch to better connections as they become available
  enabled: false

  # Seconds between evaluations of available connections
  # The auto-selector will periodically check if a better connection is available
  evaluation_interval: 30

  # Minimum score improvement required to trigger a connection switch
  # This prevents excessive switching for marginal improvements
  # Score range is 0-100, so 10.0 means a 10% improvement is required
  min_score_improvement: 10.0

  # Initial delay before first auto-selection (seconds)
  # This allows connections to stabilize after startup
  initial_delay: 10
